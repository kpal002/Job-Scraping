# Job-Scrapping
Scrapping job descriptions on LinkedIn for meaningful insights before applying.

I have been actively looking for full time positions in data science and/or machine learning. A significant part of this search process involves writing resumes and cover letter catered to the need of every job description. 

What are the requirements for the category of jobs I am looking for?
Which keywords to include in the resume?
What kind of soft skills are mentioned in the job profiles?

To get some insights on the above questions, I scrapped through the relevant job profiles from LinkedIn and tried to look for some meaningful insights.
