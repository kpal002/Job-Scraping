# Job-Scrapping
Scrapping job descriptions on LinkedIn for meaningful insights before applying.

I have been actively looking for full time positions in data science and/or machine learning. A significant part of this search process involves writing resumes and cover letter catered to the need of every job description. 

What are the requirements for the category of jobs I am looking for?
Which keywords to include in the resume?
What kind of soft skills are mentioned in the job profiles?

To get some insights on the above questions, I scrapped through the relevant job profiles from LinkedIn and tried to look for some meaningful insights. 

## Here are few of the insights from Data Scientist and Machine Learning Engineer job profiles 

- For the most commonly used programming languages, python remains the top choice. A database query language like SQL is more prevelant for Data Science jobs whereas C/C++ is more common ML jobs.

- Among the most common python libraries, visualization tools like tableau and Power Bi are more essential for jobs in data science. On the other hand, as expected, ML libraries like Tensorflow and Pytorch are must have skills for ML engineers.
